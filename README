./maze-solve [-short] [-all] <filename>

Solves a maze file. With no options, the program will display the first
solution step by step. With -short, the program displays the shortest route to
the finish. With -all, the program displays all of the solutions to the maze, 
one at a time.

./maze-gen [-h <height>] [-w <width>] <filename>

Generates a maze file. If either -h or -w are provided, the default height or
width is overrided, respectively. This exports in a format that can be loaded 
by maze-solve and maze-show.

Prints the maze described by a maze file formatted to display on a terminal.

Example run:

$ cat maze
