{"name":"Maze","body":"### Description\r\nThis is a project to generate and solve mazes of any size, limited only by stack space.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n`./maze-solve [-short] [-all] <filename>`\r\n\r\nSolves a maze file. With no options, the program will display the first\r\nsolution step by step. With `-short`, the program displays the shortest route to\r\nthe finish. With `-all`, the program displays all of the solutions to the maze, \r\none at a time.\r\n\r\n`./maze-gen [-h <height>] [-w <width>] <filename>`\r\n\r\nGenerates a maze file. If either `-h` or `-w` are provided, the specified height or\r\nwidth, respectively, is used instead. This exports in a format that can be loaded \r\nby `maze-solve` and `maze-show`.\r\n\r\n`./maze-show <filename>`\r\n\r\nPrints the maze described by a maze file formatted to display on a terminal.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n[A huge example of a solved maze.](http://students.uwf.edu/mte2/files/bigsolved.txt)\r\n\r\n### Copyright\r\nMatthew Eckert (@mteckert).
